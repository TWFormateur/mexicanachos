Preparation steps

1 Peel the onion and chop it. Brown it for a few minutes in a pan with a drizzle of olive oil. Add the minced meat and the peeled and chopped garlic. Brown for 10 minutes.
2 Meanwhile, cut the pepper in half, cut it into cubes as well as the tomatoes.
3 Add the pepper to the pan, half of the tomatoes and the drained and rinsed red beans. Salt and pepper then add the spices. Brown for 10 minutes until the water from the tomatoes evaporates. Add half a lime juice and mix.
3 Preheat the oven to 200°C.
4 Spread a little stuffing in the center of each tortilla and close the tortillas. Arrange them in an ovenproof dish. Add the rest of the tomatoes previously blended to make a purée, then sprinkle with Gruyère cheese.
5 Bake for 20 min.
